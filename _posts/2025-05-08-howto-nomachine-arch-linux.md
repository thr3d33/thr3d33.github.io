### Download

If you want to install NoMachine on a Arch Linux distribution, download the compressed NoMachine tar package from the web site.
You can head over to their downloads page to see what other products/services they offer
[NoMachine Downloads](https://www.nomachine.com/download) or head straight to the Linux download page [Linux Binaries](https://download.nomachine.com/download/?id=1&platform=linux)

### Verify

The NoMachine team provides a `md5` signature for verifying the packages you download form their website. 

```bash
md5sum <pkgName>_<pkgVersion>_<arch>.tar.gz | grep <md5_signature>
```

Example using latest package as of this post
```bash
md5sum nomachine_9.0.188_11_x86_64.tar.gz | grep d8fed96bce337b13b602593b850a432e
```

Output:
`d8fed96bce337b13b602593b850a432e *nomachine_9.0.188_11_x86_64.tar.gz`

### Extract

Install NoMachine or any of the server packages:

If you want to install to the default location `/usr/NX` ensure that package is placed there. Alternatively `/usr/local/bin/` and `/opt` can be used.  

> In this tutorial `/usr/local/bin` is used to extract the installation package.
> While the installation directory will be in `/opt`
{: .prompt-info }

**Extract the archive in the /usr/local/bin/ directory:**

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin/
sudo tar xvzf <pkgName>_<pkgVersion>_<arch>.tar.gz  
```
### Install
 
> Read all scripts that you wish to run, especially those that require privileged access.
{: .prompt-warning }

**Run the `nxserver` script:**

Use `--install` option for installation.
```bash
cd NX
# Adding the redhat flag after --install is required when installing on Arch and Arch-based distros as its not officially supported. 
sudo NX/nxserver --install redhat 
```

Alternatively, 
Using non-default location like `/opt`.
```bash
sudo NX_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt /usr/local/bin/NX/nxserver --install redhat
```

#### Install via AUR
#### [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/):

There is a `nomachine` package on the Arch User Repository maintained by [runnytu](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nomachine) if you want to give that a try.

#### Post-Install:

Some useful environment variables:
```shell
# Environment Variables
# Exporting the Installation directory for NX  
export NX_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt
# Adding NX to PATH.
export NX_HOME=/opt/NX
export PATH=$PATH:$NX_HOME/bin
```
### Update

Use `--update` option to update your installation.
```bash
# This script executes another located in /etx/NX/
sudo /opt/NX/bin/nxserver --update
```
### Uninstall

Use `--uninstall` option to uninstall your installation.
```bash
sudo /opt/NX/scripts/setup/nxserver --uninstall
```

Then remove the NX directory.
```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/NX
```
